Hello and welcome to my number guessing game! It's very simple and self-explanatory, so the purpose of this file is just to show how to view it.

First, download the ZIP file.
Unzip it.
Open the folder that says JS-guessr-main. It might say something a little different, but it's ok if it is.
Don't open the files 'homeScript.js' or 'homeStyle.css'. Those are the code files, and what you want to do is open 'home.html'.
Doing this will automagically open up the page from your default browser ( Chrome, Edge, Opera, Firefox, etc.)
And play!
